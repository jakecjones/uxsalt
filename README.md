## `Grid system`

before you begin, wrap your code with the 
```css
.container
```

All the code works on a 12 column grid system. Some important classes to remember are 

```css
.sm-1 .md-1 .lg-1
```

Any number bewtween 1 and 12 can be used to define how many columns an item may take. For example: 

```css
.sm-4 .md-1 .lg-12

```


## Using the code

find a good spot to place a .scss file and your off to the races!
